								<p>During my time at Worthington Steel, I worked on mechanical design upgrades across the pickle line and storage yard to improve equipment performance and layout efficiency.</p>
								<p>One of my first projects was reworking a squeegee roll stand based on an outdated AutoCAD design. The original assembly had stability issues and was set at the wrong height, so I redesigned the entire unit in SolidWorks â€” improving its structure, alignment, and accessibility. The final design was implemented directly on the line.</p>

                                <p>I also developed a new carry-over table design from scratch for the stitcher entry/exit, collaborating with maintenance and vendors to finalize it for production. The system improved material flow and simplified transitions between key sections of the line.</p>
                                <p>Outside the facility, I redesigned the coil storage layout to maximize space and accessibility. The updated configuration more than tripled coil capacity while improving retrieval flow and equipment access.</p>

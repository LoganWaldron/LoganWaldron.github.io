								<p>During my internship at GM, I worked with the Quality Engineering team supporting transmission production. My main focus was solving real-world manufacturing issues using a design-first mindset — working across teams to reduce variation, improve visual inspection, and standardize quality processes.</p>

                                <p>I led deep-dive investigations into defects on key machining lines and helped drive long-term fixes through collaboration with operators, engineers, and plant leadership. Along the way, I designed new inspection workflows, created tools that made it easier to catch issues early, and supported updates that made problem-solving more visual, intuitive, and repeatable.</p>

                                <p>I also used data visualization tools to analyze variation trends and support decisions around process improvement. Altogether, the solutions I worked on led to meaningful time and cost savings for the plant — but more importantly, gave me a hands-on understanding of how design plays a critical role in building better manufacturing systems.</p>
